While this is meant to be primarily an online tutorial, we find it important to remind people that we should always strive to work in and create a inclusive, positive environment in which to work.

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people. We do not tolerate harassment or abuse by or toward anyone participating in this program at any level.  Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:

Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above
causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation.

* The display of sexual or violent images
* Sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
* Incitement to violence
* Intro 2 Astro interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

This workshop stands behind the principle open inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and constructive disagreement in research and education.
